### Why asset manager is Windows Desktop only?
Nowadays hobbists develop games on their Windows based computers, on desktop. Therefore it is pointless browsing your assets on portable, mobile devices.

### Why BVH motion format is supported only?
It is the most widely known format across motion capture formats. It is the most easiest, human-readable format and can be converted to almost any other motion capture formats.

### Why only OBJ files are supported as 3D objects?
OBJ is the most traditional and generally used 3D format. Almost every 3D software can load/import/export it. Just as BVH, so OBJ is the most easiest, human-readable format that can be converted to a wide range of other 3D formats.

### Why JPG, PNG, BMP texture formats allowed only?
Hobby/Indie game developers don't really care about well-proven game texture standards. So traditional image formats are generally accepted in startup/garage teams. You knwo what? The game engine will do the rest...

### Why there is no preview on Substances, PSDs?
I ain't got enough resources to accomplish that kind of huge interpretation of these formats. But you can import preview images beside those assets.

### Why only Wav sound format is accepted?
Easy to work with them, and no codec is needed for playback. Maybe that's all.

### Why only TrueType Format is accepted as Font?
Hmmm... I must admit I got plenty of them...

### Only four script formats? Are you serious?
Yes. Who need more? These are the most standard programming languages in hobby/professional game development.

### UnityPackages? You are crazy!
Ok, it is not a general game asset type, but I got bunch of them...
